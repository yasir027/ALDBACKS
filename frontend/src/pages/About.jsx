ABOUT US AND THE PRODUCT In the year 1995 a new star was born in the legal firmament of Andhra Pradesh in the shape of ANDHRA LEGAL DECISIONS (Fortnightly) thanks to the business enterprise of Mr. Hasin Ahmed and the editorial expertise of Shree K.V. Ramana Rao. The unrelenting efforts and single minded devotion and dedication of   Shree K.V. Ramana Rao carved out a niche for the journal in the legal pantheon. In 1996 a companion journal “ANDHRA LEGAL DECISIONS – CRIMINAL (Monthly)” was launched to serve the needs of the lawyers practicing on criminal side. It was followed by yet another journal to compliment the contents of parent journals “Andhra Legal Decisions” and “Andhra Legal Decisions – Criminal” in the name of ALL INDIA LAW DIGEST with STATUTORY DIARY AND READERS FORUM (Monthly) to keep the esteemed subscribers of two parent journals abreast of decisions rendered by High Courts other than Andhra Pradesh High Court, to update their information as to statutory changes taking place from time to time and to express and share their views on legal issues.
